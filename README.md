## AI-powered Chat with ChatGPT-like Models (Markdown)

This document outlines a basic framework for integrating a large language model (like ChatGPT) into your application to enable interactive conversations.

**Getting Started**

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   $ yarn
   ```

2. **Obtain API Key**

   - Create an account with OpenAI ([https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/))
   - Generate an API key and store it securely in a `.env` file:

     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

**Code Overview**

- `openai`: Connects to the OpenAI API for accessing the language model.
- `promptSync`: Enables user input through the terminal prompt.
- `boxen` & `chalk` (Optional): Customize the conversation UI with colored boxes.
- `main` Function:
  - Processes user input and conversation history.
  - Sends prompts to the OpenAI model and retrieves responses.

**Running the Code**

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (see Getting Started).
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

3. The program will initiate a chat session. Type your prompts and the AI will respond.
4. Type "exit" to terminate the conversation.

**Customization**

This is a basic example. You can extend it to integrate with your specific application logic and tailor the conversation flow for your needs.
